# Spotify Slave

Turn your Spotify player into a slave of your peers' will. Just connect to an instance of [Spotify Server](https://github.com/ahultgren/Spotify-Server) and anyone with access to the server can controll your Spotify player. On any OS.

Currently (version 0.3) there's not much of a GUI or features, but more will come!

## Installation

* Clone this repo  
    `$ git clone git://github.com/ahultgren/Spotify-Server.git`
* Move the directory to ~/Spotify on OSX or /Users/username/Spotify on Windows (I have absolutely no clue where to put this stuff on linux, but chances are if you're a linux user you know how to figure it out).  
    `$ mv Spotify-Slave ~/Spotify/spotify-slave`
* Get yourself a [developer account](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer-account) (you must have **Spotify Premium**)
* Restart spotify and search for the app!  
	`spotify:app:slave`

This process will be much easier if I ever would get admitted to the Spotify Apps library.

## Contribution

Contributions are very much appreciated. Might need some on the design part, as I'm mainly a developer.

Thanks to [Fr√∂jd](http://frojd.se) for letting me work on this during work time (aka Hackdays)!

Oh, and I'd be happy if you tell people it's me (Andreas Hultgren) who built this.
