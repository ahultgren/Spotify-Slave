# Review of your app

Hi Andreas, 

We have reviewed your app.

The idea is similar to other apps currently available in the App Finder. We believe that the concept and design is not strong enough for us to approve the app. The design needs to be both detailed and polished and there are a number of gaps to fill for us to feel that the execution of the idea (the finalized app) will be good enough for us to approve the app. Therefore, we unfortunately have to reject the app. If you want to, you can rework/update your concept and send us a new submission.

Best Regards

Peter
